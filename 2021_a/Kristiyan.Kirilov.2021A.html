<h1> <font color="IndianRed">The Phone</font> </h1>

<h3>Last night a friend rushed me out of the house to catch the opening act at a local bar’s music night.</h3>
<h3>After a few drinks I realized my phone wasn’t in my pocket.</h3>
<h3>I checked the table we were sitting at, the bar, the bathrooms, and after no luck I used my friend’s phone to call mine.</h3>
<h3>After two rings someone answered, gave out a low raspy giggle and hung up.</h3>
<h3>They didn’t answer again. I eventually gave it up as a lost cause and headed home.</h3>
<h2>I found my phone laying on my nightstand, right where I left it.</h2>
