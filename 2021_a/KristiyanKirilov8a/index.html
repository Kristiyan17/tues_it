        <h1>The Phone</h1>

        <p>Last night a friend rushed me out of the house to catch the opening act at a local bar’s music night.</br>
        After a few drinks I realized my phone wasn’t in my pocket.</br>
        I checked the table we were sitting at, the bar, the bathrooms, and after no luck I used my friend’s phone to call mine.</br>
        After two rings someone answered, gave out a low raspy giggle and hung up.</br>
        They didn’t answer again. I eventually gave it up as a lost cause and headed home.</p>

        <h2>I found my phone laying on my nightstand, right where I left it.</h2>
